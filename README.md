### The Project

Basic collapsible list component made by using React. I've completed this project at the very beginning of my learning process of React. It is a single page application, holding json file as a main source of our data. It consists of fake questions answers and categories. Each category has its own color and will be displayed accordingly. So that project is a bit more dynamic.

### Challenges

To form up basic working structure was not a big deal for me. I had a little bit of a struggle to design the icons. Mostly about changing the direction of icon whenever specific item is clicked. I had to use CSS features to compile this functionality. At the end I have managed to accomplish my goals with this project.
